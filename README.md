# Photoshop Instagram Carousel Splitter

This project automates the creation of **seamless Instagram carousel posts** using Photoshop scripting.  
It slices an image into 1080×1350px frames (Instagram’s portrait format) and ensures the second frame aligns perfectly with the first, so when swiped, the carousel flows smoothly without visible jumps.

---

## ✨ Features
- Automatically slices a large image into Instagram-ready frames.  
- Maintains **alignment across X and Y axes** for a seamless swipe experience.  
- Works directly inside **Adobe Photoshop 2025** via ExtendScript (`.jsx`).  
- Includes a **Python wrapper** to trigger the Photoshop script from the terminal.
